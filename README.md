# React Image Gallery

## Tasks:
-> In this mini project, we are required to create an image gallery using React.
-> The gallery should fetch a set of images from <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O7j0icYwTGiqZLUWm8iff6bCb72aiqW2/view'>Api</a>, limit the result to 20 images, and display them in a user-friendly UI.
-> Upon clicking on any image, the user should be redirected to a single image view, where additional information, such as the tile and description of the image, is shown.
